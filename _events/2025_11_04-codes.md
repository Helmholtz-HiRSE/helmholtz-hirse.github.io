HiRSE, HIFIS and HIDA are hosting a 3-day workshop for people writing and maintaining research software within Helmholtz. During this event, we will discuss options on how Helmholtz could further support our daily work in research software engineering.

The event will focus on three sessions:
1. What if there is no additional money coming in for research software?
2. What if we had a huge amount of money waiting for us?
3. What if this amount were small(er)?
These interactive sessions will be accompanied by presentations from the different services and offers we already have in Helmholtz as well as by a keynote by Laurent Romary (Inria, France) on Research Software and Open Science Policies at Inria (tentative title).

As a result we would like to have a short position paper from all of us, summarizing our findings and presenting them to Helmholtz decision makers.

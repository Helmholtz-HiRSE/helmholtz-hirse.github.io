On November 26-27, 2024, we will have our forth HiRSE_PS live meeting, at the [Seminaris CampusHotel Berlin](https://www.seminaris.de/hotels/tagungshotel-berlin-dahlem/), live, in person! Registration is open now: <https://events.hifis.net/event/1737>

With the HiRSE_PS project in its final year, and the flexible Joint Lab HiRSE approved, it is time to meet in person again and talk in detail about what happened, what will happen, what is good and what is bad.

The agenda is currently under preparation and will be announced as soon as possible. So far, the plan is to have short presentations on what has been done in individual codes and work packages within HiRSE_PS (what has been made possible, started, intensified, implemented, ....? How is the benefit of the funding by HiRSE_PS measurable?) and what is still to be accomplished within HiRSE_PS until the end of 2024 for the project. Also, there will be time for discussion, exchange and working on the codes.

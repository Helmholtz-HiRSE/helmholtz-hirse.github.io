With the HiRSE project now a full-fledged Joint Lab, it is time to meet in person again and talk in detail about what happened, what will happen, what is good and what is bad.

The agenda is currently under preparation and will be announced as soon as possible. So far, the plan is to have short presentations on what has been done in individual codes and work packages within HiRSE (what has been made possible, started, intensified, implemented, ....? How is the benefit of the funding by HiRSE_PS measurable?) with a dedicated focus on the AI activities of the groups. As always, there will be plenty of time for discussion, exchange and working on the codes.

# Joint Lab HiRSE: Helmholtz Information - Research Software Engineering

Welcome to the Joint Lab HiRSE! We believe that research software is too important to be considered as "just there". It needs continuous care, good practices, experience, and sometimes guidance, very much like all other results, tools, and infrastructures of science.

This project brings together research software engineers, domain scientists, and community experts to support research software and the people behind it within the [Helmholtz Information](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/research/research-fields/information/). The HiRSE concept considers central, community-oriented activities in RSE and the targeted, sustainable funding of strategically important codes by so-called Community Software Infrastructure groups as mutually supportive aspects of a single entity.

Driven by a dedicated and diverse team from the four participating [partner institutions](partners.html#hirse-partners) Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon, and Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin, we run open-to-all community events like the [HiRSE Seminar Series](series.html), promote [research software made in Germany](promo.html), and foster collaborative, sustainable research software engineering through our [Community Software Infrastructure groups](codes.html). Our work is organized in two work packages, covering the decentral groups in one and the central community activities in a second package. 

This project is funded by the [Innovation Fund](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/transfer/helmholtz-association-transfer-instruments/innovation-fund-of-the-helmholtz-centers/) of [Helmholtz Information](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/research/research-fields/information/) of the [Helmholtz Association](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/) as well as by the four participating [partners](partners.html#hirse-partners).

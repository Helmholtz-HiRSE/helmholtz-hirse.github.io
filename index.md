# Joint Lab HiRSE: Helmholtz Information - Research Software Engineering

Welcome to the Joint Lab HiRSE! We believe that research software is too important to be considered as "just there". It needs continuous care, good practices, experience, and sometimes guidance, very much like all other results, tools, and infrastructures of science.

This project brings together research software engineers, domain scientists, and community experts to support research software and the people behind it within [Helmholtz Information](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/research/research-fields/information/). 
HiRSE has two main ingredients:

* Providing targeted, sustainable funding for strategically important [codes](codes.html) organised via Community Software Infrastructure groups.
* Organizing community-focused activities both for the project participants and the research software engineering community across Germany.

The joint lab is driven by a dedicated and diverse team from the four participating [partner institutions](partners.html#hirse-partners) Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon, and Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. All results, events, initiatives, offers, and resources of the Joint Lab can be found on this website.

This project is funded by the [Innovation Fund](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/transfer/helmholtz-association-transfer-instruments/innovation-fund-of-the-helmholtz-centers/) of [Helmholtz Information](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/research/research-fields/information/) of the [Helmholtz Association](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/) as well as by the four participating [partners](partners.html#hirse-partners).

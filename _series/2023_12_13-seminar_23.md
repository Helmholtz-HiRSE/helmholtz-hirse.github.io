On December 13, 2023, 3pm, [**Sandra Gesing**](http://sandra-gesing.com), Executive Director in the [US Research Software Engineers Association (US-RSE)](https://us-rse.org/) and Senior Researcher at the [San Diego Supercomputer Center](https://www.sdsc.edu/) will continue the HiRSE Seminar with her talk on **US-RSE: Envisioning the Next Stage and Defining Next Steps**.

**Abstract**:
US-RSE has had a lot of momentum and positive energy from the beginning in 2018. It gained even more in the last couple of months evident in the rising numbers of members growing to over 2100 and the sold out inaugural conference in Chicago. The grant of the Sloan foundation allows for the first time that staff members can complement the volunteer effort: Sandra Gesing as the Executive Director at 50% and a soon-to-be-announced full-time community manager. These roles will take US-RSE to the next level beyond volunteer work. One of the goal is the creation of non-traditional career paths  for RSEs that are lacking in the academic and national lab world. The seminar will go into Sandra’s vision for the role of the executive director to achieve financial sustainability for US-RSE, community activities and major tasks for the next couple of months.

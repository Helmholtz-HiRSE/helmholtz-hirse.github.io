On January 23, 2025, 11am CET, **Carlos Martinez Ortiz** from [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/team/dr-carlos-martinez-ortiz/) will start off the HiRSE Seminar in 2025 with his talk about **Software Management Plans: how do they lead to better research?**
<!--more-->

**Abstract**:

In this talk I will talk about the Practical guidelines for Software Management Plans (SMP) ([https://zenodo.org/record/7185371](https://zenodo.org/record/7185371)), developed by the Netherlands eScience Center and the Dutch funding council (NWO). Starting from the concept of what are SMPs, and what are the development practices that they encourage, I will explain how the guidelines have been implemented at different places. I will also talk about tools that have been (and are being developed) to help researchers implement good practices when developing research software for their own research.

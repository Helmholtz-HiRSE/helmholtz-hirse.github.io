On Thursday, 18th September at 11am CEST, **[Robert Hilbrich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberthilbrich)** from the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/) will join us at the HiRSE Seminar Series to talk about **"From Code to Community: Growing Research Software with Open Source Foundations."**
<!--more-->

**Abstract**: 
Many research software projects begin with an open GitHub repository – an important first step to make software visible, accessible, and usable. But what comes next? When does it make sense to move beyond “just” a repository towards a sustainable ecosystem with clear governance, long-term support, and active community engagement?
In this talk, I will share our experience of taking this step with SUMO in 2017, when the German Aerospace Center (DLR) joined the Eclipse Foundation. I will outline the motivations behind this move, the challenges we faced, and the benefits we observed in terms of visibility, collaboration, and sustainability. After a short 15-minute introduction, I invite you to join an open discussion in an “Ask Me Anything” style format, to exchange perspectives and experiences on how to grow and sustain open source research software communities.

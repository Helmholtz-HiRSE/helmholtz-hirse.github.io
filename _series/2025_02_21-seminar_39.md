<!--more-->

**Abstract**:

The Helmholtz Association is adding a new indicator for research data and research software publications to its reporting. A working group with members from all Helmholtz centers has been working on defining this new indicator and the Helmholtz general assembly has approved their suggestion in its fall meeting of 2024. In this talk the indicator as well as the ideas behind it and the methods to collect the information are introduced. The indicator is based on a maturity model looking at various aspects of a research software publication, thus also providing value to the authors of the software and research software researchers as it makes multiple aspects of research software as a scientific publication itself visible.

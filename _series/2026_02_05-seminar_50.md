On **Thursday, 5th February** at 11:00am CET the HiRSE Seminar Series will feature the **winners of the 2025 Helmholtz Software Award**. 

**Abstract:** The Helmholtz Research Software Award aims to promote the development of professional, high-quality, and sustainable research software and to recognize commitment to software as the basis of modern data science. The Helmholtz Software Award is presented by Helmholtz Federated IT Services (HIFIS), the Helmholtz Information & Data Science Academy (HIDA), and the Helmholtz Open Science Office.

Winners in the three categories Scientific Originality, Sustainability and Newcomer, were selected by international experts and a final selection committee.  The winners of the 2024 awards are:
 
Scientific Originality Prize: **CP2K** (Quantum Chemistry and Solid State Physics). CP2K is a quantum chemistry and solid state physics software package running on graphics processing units and thousands of processing units. It is open-source and allows simulations, spectroscopy, vibrational analysis and energy minimization on a vast variety of theory levels.
*	Speaker: Thomas Kühne (HZDR)

Sustainability Prize: **FastSurfer** (Human Brain MRI Analysis).  FastSurfer is a fast and accurate deep-learning pipeline for the analysis of human brain MRI. FastSurfer provides a fully compatible FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric and surface-based thickness analysis, also supporting sub-mm resolutions, and sub-segmentation of neuroanatomical structures.
*	Speaker: Martin Reuter (DZNE)

Newcomer Prize: **MemBrain v2** (Cryo-ET Membranes Analysis). MemBrain v2 aims to facilitate the analysis of membranes in cryo-electron tomography data. It consists of the components membrain-seg for membrane segmentation, membrain-pick for membrane protein localization, and membrain-stats for the extraction of membrane-based metrics.

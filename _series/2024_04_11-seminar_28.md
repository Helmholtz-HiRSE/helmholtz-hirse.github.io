**Abstract**:
Researchers rely on a variety of systems and tools when it comes to administering their research data. Processes involving research data management include proposal submission, data management planning, simulation campaigns, documentation during the experiment, and the creation and submission of journal and data publications. HELIPORT is a data management solution that aims at making all steps of the research experiment’s life cycle discoverable, accessible, interoperable and reusable according to the FAIR principles. This is done by linking to and interfacing with established tools and solutions, and exchanging metadata between systems involved in a project. The metadata are presented to the researchers through a web interface, but they are also accessible to computational agents via API and machine-readable landing pages. In this presentation, we will introduce the metadata project HELIPORT and what provided the impulse for the project, discuss the documentation of a real experiment in HELIPORT, and outline current developments and challenges.

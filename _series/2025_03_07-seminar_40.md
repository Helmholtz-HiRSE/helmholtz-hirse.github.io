On March 7, 2025, 11am CET, **Samantha Wittke** from [CSC – IT Center for Science](https://csc.fi/en/) will continue the HiRSE Seminar with her talk about **CodeRefinery: A Community for Teaching, Learning, and Growing Together**
<!--more-->

**Abstract**:

This talk will introduce the CodeRefinery project, its workshops, and its community, and explore how you can engage, contribute, and benefit from our resources as a researcher or Research Software Engineer.

CodeRefinery is a community-driven, publicly funded project dedicated to improving research code by providing hands-on training and open learning materials for researchers across disciplines. Our workshops focus on practical tools and "good enough" research software engineering practices that are often missing from traditional academic education—such as version control, reproducible research, collaborative development, and efficient coding techniques fostering Open Science and FAIR software development.

In addition to workshops and learning materials, CodeRefinery fosters a supportive and inclusive community where Research Software Engineers and enthusiasts can share knowledge, exchange experiences, and find opportunities for collaboration. This community-driven approach has enabled the joint organization of specialized workshops, such as high-performance computing (HPC) kick-off and "Tools and Techniques for HPC", addressing a wide range of computational research needs.

There are many ways to get involved with/support/ benefit from CodeRefinery:
* Join a workshop as a learner
* Bring your team and learn together
* Host a local classroom to follow the workshop with colleagues
* Teach with us—become a co-instructor
* Contribute to lesson materials
* Provide feedback to help us improve
* Use our materials for your own training events

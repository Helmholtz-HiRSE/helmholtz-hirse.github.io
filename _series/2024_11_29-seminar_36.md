On November 29, 2024, 2pm CET, **Florian Goth** from [Univeristät Würzburg](https://www.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/tp1/team/postdocs/dr-florian-goth/) will talk in the HiRSE Seminar about **The teachingRSE project - Towards a professionalization of RSE education**.
<!--more-->

**Abstract**:

At the deRSE23, a group of people came together for a small workshop to discuss how to deal with questions revolving around RSE education. Overwhelmed by the immense resonance to that workshop we took home a tremendous amount of feedback that made obvious that a short blog post will not suffice to adequately represent it. Now it is two years later, and the project produced its first output, the second position paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11457>  of de-RSE e.V. and it has sprawled out into a multitude of follow-up projects.
In this talk, I will give an overview over the original ideas that we tried to convey in the position paper, and detail our future work plan as well as possibilities for contributing.

On **Tuesday, 18th November** at 11am CEST, [**Giuditta Parolin**](https://giudittaparolini.wordpress.com) from the Museum für Naturkunde-Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science in Berlin will join us at the HiRSE Seminar Series to talk about **“AI Coding Assistants in Research Software: Legal Aspects”**
<!--more-->

**Abstract**: 
The seminar focuses on the legal aspects associated with the use of AI coding assistants in developing research software. It considers intellectual property rights on software and the terms and conditions of free and open-source software licences and uses this legal framework to explain the pitfalls associated with the use of AI assistants for generating code and software documentation. In particular, the seminar examines the unclear copyright status of AI generated code, the potential infringement of third-party intellectual property rights when using the output of AI assistants, and the danger to share confidential or personal information while providing context for prompting AI assistants. Real-world examples of these issues are considered to clarify the matter. The presentation format is interactive, and attendees are invited to share their experiences with software licensing and AI generated code and documentation.

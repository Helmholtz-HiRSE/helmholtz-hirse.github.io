On June 20, 2024, 11am CEST, **Caroline Jay** from the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/our-people/caroline-jay) and [The University of Manchester](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/caroline.jay) will continue the HiRSE Seminar with his talk on **Research Software Engineering and Software Engineering Research: Bridging Knowledge Gaps**.

**Abstract**:
Research software underpins computational research across many academic disciplines, and we might therefore assume that software engineering researchers (SERs), who investigate and develop methods to improve the quality of software and its lifecycle processes, have a strong interest in this growing area. Conversely, we might assume that research software engineers (RSEs) who must select, customize, and apply software engineering methods to create research software have an interest in the production and adoption of novel methods. Whilst there is strong theoretical overlap between these communities, in reality they interact very little. This talk will provide a overview of and personal reflection on a recent Dagstuhl seminar bringing RSEs and SERs together, covering the challenges of tribalism and terminology, and the opportunities of a new interdisciplinary research area.

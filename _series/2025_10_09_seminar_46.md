On Thursday, 9th October at 2pm CEST, **Felicity Anderson** will join us at the HiRSE Seminar Series to talk about **“Who Do You Think You Are? Creating RSE Personas from GitHub Interactions in Research Software Repositories...”**
<!--more-->

**Abstract**: 
Flic Anderson introduces Research Software Engineering (RSE) Personas - a novel research approach for explaining and exploring patterns in how contributors interact with collaborative research software (RS) repositories on GitHub. The talk briefly covers how 7 RSE personas were identified using a data-driven approach, and what these different RSE Personas can tell us about RS contributors from GitHub API data. She will also discuss how this research is currently being expanded, and how the RSE community could use this concept in the future to support RSEs and RS teams to build their skills, build better teams, and ultimately build better software!
This talk expands on the deRSE 2025 poster: [Who Do You Think You Are? Identifying Research Software Engineering Personas From Developer / Repository Interaction Data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14988656).

On Thursday, 18th September at 11am CEST, **[Dr. Robert Hilbrich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberthilbrich)** from the [Eclipse Foundation](https://www.eclipse.org/) will join us at the HiRSE Seminar Series to talk about **"From Code to Community: Growing Research Software with Open Source Foundations."**
<!--more-->

**Abstract**: 
Many research software projects begin with an open GitHub repository - an important first step to make software visible, accessible, and usable. But what comes next? When does it make sense to move beyond “just” a repository towards a sustainable ecosystem with clear governance, long-term support, and active community engagement? In this talk, Robert will share their experience of taking this step with SUMO in 2017, when the German Aerospace Center (DLR) joined the Eclipse Foundation. He will outline the motivations behind this move, the challenges they faced, and the benefits they observed in terms of visibility, collaboration, and sustainability. After a short 15-minute introduction, he invites you to join an open discussion in an “Ask Me Anything” style format, to exchange perspectives and experiences on how to grow and sustain open-source research software communities.

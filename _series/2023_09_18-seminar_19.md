**Abstract**:
In today's research landscape, research software and Research Software Engineering (RSE) play pivotal roles, and receive increasing recognition within the scientific community. Additionally, there is a growing interest in researching RSE practices themselves, aiming to better understand software development processes in science and enhance them.

In this talk I take a closer look at the interconnection of research software, research software engineering, software research, software engineering research, RSE research, an more. I provide an overview of RSE research topics and initiatives, offering insights into this evolving field and presenting opportunities for involvement.

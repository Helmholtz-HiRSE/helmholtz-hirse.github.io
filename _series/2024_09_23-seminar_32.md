**Abstract**:
In 2023 the Helmholtz Association opened the call for the first Helmholtz Software Award. The award aims to promote the development of professional and high-quality research software and to recognize the commitment to software as the basis of modern science. It puts the spotlight on sustainable development and operation of research software and recognizes the importance of collaboration between research software engineers and will help making research software available for re-use.

After evaluation of the submissions by international experts and a final selection by a committee, the winners in the three categories Scientific Originality, Sustainability and Newcomer were selected and the centers of the winners were informed by the Helmholtz President, Prof. Dr. Otmar D. Wiestler.

The winners of the awards are:

* Scientific Originality Prize to **CellRank**:
CellRank is a computational framework to study cellular fate decisions based on various types of single-cell genomics data. CellRank scales to large cell numbers, is fully compatible with the scverse ecosystem, and is easy to use.  
Speaker: Philipp Weiler (HMGU)

* Sustainability Prize to **ESMValTool**:
The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) is an open-source community-developed diagnostics and performance metrics tool for the evaluation and analysis of Earth System Models (ESMs). ESMValTool allows for a comparison of single or multiple models against predecessor versions and observations.  
Speaker: Birgit Hassler (DLR)

* Newcomer Prize to **openCARP**:
openCARP is a multiscale cardiac electrophysiology simulator for in silico experiments ranging from single heart cells and cardiac tissue to organ models up to the body surface ECG.  
Speaker: Marie Houillon (KIT)
Contact: Axel LÃ¶we (KIT)

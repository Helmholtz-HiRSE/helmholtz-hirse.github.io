**Rerun from 2022**

On November 15, 2023, 2pm, [**Jessica Mitchell**](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/mitchell_j) from [FZJ/INM-6](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-6) will present at the HiRSE Seminar with her talk on **Docs-as-code: how to write documentation with developers**. 
<!--more-->

**Abstract**: 
Documentation is often an overlooked part of software development. Here I discuss the concept of docs-as-code as way to streamline documentation development alongside the code. From writing, reviewing, and testing documentation, I will show how the same workflows used in code development can be applied to documentation.  We will look into this concept and show how this can work in practical setting using NEST simulator as an example.

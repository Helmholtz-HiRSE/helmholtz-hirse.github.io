# HiRSE Summer of Testing

Testing your research software is an important step in the software development life cycle and should come before deployment and maintenance. Testing your code will reduce your debugging time and certain tests not only help your code to be correct but helps you to hit other goals like speed and portability.

But how to get started with testing? And if you’re in the deployment phase already, is it worth retro-fitting tests to your research software?

The HiRSE Summer of Testing series of videos addresses what is testing, why different types of tests exist, why it’s important and how to do it in several programming languages.

We suggest that you start with the “Introduction to Continuous Testing’ episode and then choose from episodes focusing on C++, Julia, Python. After that, the final two episodes focus on what to do next once you’ve introduced testing and how to continue with testing in production. All videos can be found on the [HiRSE YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Helmholtz_Platform_for_RSE) or at the links below:

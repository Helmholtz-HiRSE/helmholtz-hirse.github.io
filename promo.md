# The HiRSE Code Promotion - shining a light on your work

Researchers, postdocs, and students at German universities and research centres
write great research software. The HiRSE team wants to make that more visible
by bringing your software to the attention of the RSE Community and beyond.
We're looking for research software created, extended and/or maintained by
people working at German institutions to join our latest initiative. This is
not meant exclusively, we of course welcome also software written by
international teams, as long as there is a substantial contribution coming from
Germany.

## Quick overview

Following the start of this HiRSE initiative right at the beginning of summer
2024, only 4 weeks later we have heard back from almost 50 developers or teams of
developers, eager to present their work. The replies come from a rather diverse
set of codes spawning multiple scientific disciplines and range from frontends
to existing codes over codes providing services to simulation codes running at
the largest supercomputers.

A common theme for many of them: the wish for sustainable funding not only for
lighthouse projects and new developments, but also for established codes. Of
course, they also want to increase their community and look for widespread use
of their codes, otherwise they would not be here.
